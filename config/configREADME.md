# myConfigfiles
Here is the mess of configuration and customization files I have for my terminal.  Plz don't hate on it, I didn't (and still don't) know what I was doing.

*Warning: I have aliases and keybindings in addition to the pretty stuff in my config files and they might not appy to your setup*


Here's a screenshot of my pretty terminal

### 2. MacVim
I also don't know why I use it but it works well with my Mac (I'm running OSX Mojave as of July 4, 2019 Version 10.14.5)

### 3. ZSH with Oh-my-zsh
This plugin makes tab completion so smooth and it makes me happy.

### 4. Tmux
Great for splitting panes and multitasking and it makes me feel cool

### 5. Powerline with Powerlevel9k
This makes me feel the coolest because it adds pretty and usefull stuff to my ZSH terminal promt, my vim status line, and TMUX status line
