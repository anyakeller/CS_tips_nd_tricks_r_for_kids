# Tricks r 4 kidz
###### Silly rabbit, we all need cheatsheets and so do I.  Fork and customize me!
###### An everything reference for stuff CS

### Guidelines:
- Keep it to the basics.  There are many guides and cheat sheets out there but they often include commands and tricks that are unnesscesary for beginners or understanding the fundimentals.  If you want to make an advanced cheat cheat make sure it's labeled as advanced in the file name
- Organize related cheat sheets in corresponding directories. 
- Mild swearing is allowed but be tasteful. Jokes and fuckery are allowed but remember, be tasteful and if the jokes make the documentation too confusing or side tracked don't add it.
- USE MARKDOWN FILES AND SYNTAX, NO .txt unless it's an example code file

### TODO:
- Add templates and entire example files
- Add algorithm and sort and searches guide
- Add CSS reference sheet
- Add JS reference sheet
- Add top used library funtion guide for different languages
